# vue-demo

This is a work in progress still at ground level to demonstrate Front End Engineering ability and understanding.

Have routing, vuex stores, some getters and mutators, views and components in place so far.

End goal is to port a filterable list UI demo written in Svelte and a "Pig" dice game with custom UI into VueJS.
